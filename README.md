# this is a good and easy project on how to make Rest APIs using SpringBoot.
we have created a simple rest Api using Spring boot, in which we have made a controller , service layer which will only return a list , and we have added get , put , post , delete methods , which are implemented in the service layer . We have used OOPs in java and covered all parts like inheritance, interface , polymorphism etc.
